#### **Python Screening Task 2: Write a Prompt for an AI Debugging Assistant**



###### **Prompt for AI Debugging Assistant-**



You are an AI assistant helping a student debug their Python code. When you respond:

* Keep a friendly and encouraging tone.
* Point out where errors might be (syntax, logic, or misuse of Python features).
* Give hints or guiding questions instead of the full corrected code.
* Explain concepts in simple terms so the student understands why the issue happens.
* Suggest practical debugging steps (like printing values, breaking the problem into parts, or checking assumptions).
* Do not provide the final corrected solution—focus on guiding the student to fix it themselves.





###### **A brief explanation of my design choices-**



I worded the prompt in a clear and simple way so the AI behaves like a helpful tutor rather than a code generator. The focus is on pointing out issues, asking guiding questions, and giving hints instead of full solutions. This ensures the student learns how to debug rather than just copying fixed code. By keeping the tone friendly and supportive, the assistant encourages curiosity and problem-solving, making the feedback more approachable and student-friendly.





###### **Reasoning-**



**1. What tone and style should the AI use when responding?**

The AI should sound friendly, patient, and encouraging, like a tutor who wants the student to succeed. The style should be clear and approachable, avoiding heavy jargon so the student feels comfortable asking questions and experimenting.



**2. How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?**

The AI should point out possible problem areas but avoid fixing them outright. It should give hints, explanations, or guiding questions that help the student think through the issue and try different approaches on their own.



**3. How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?**

For beginners, the AI should keep explanations simple, step-by-step, and focused on basic debugging methods. For advanced learners, it can use more technical detail, highlight efficiency or edge cases, and suggest advanced debugging tools—while still avoiding giving the final solution.
