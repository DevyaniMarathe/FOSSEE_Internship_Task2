# Python Screening Task 2 – AI Debugging Assistant Prompt

## Setup Instructions
This repository contains my submission for Task 2.  
- `Task2.txt` has the AI Debugging Assistant prompt.  
- `README.md` includes my design choices and reasoning.  
You can open these files directly; no code setup is required.

## Design Choices
I wrote the prompt to be clear and student-friendly, focusing on hints and guidance rather than full solutions. The wording makes the AI act like a mentor—supportive, approachable, and helpful.

## Reasoning
**1. Tone and Style:**  
The AI should sound supportive and approachable, like a tutor who explains clearly and encourages curiosity.  

**2. Balance between bugs and guidance:**  
The AI should identify possible problem areas but not fix them directly. Instead, it should give hints, explanations, or guiding questions.  

**3. Beginners vs. Advanced learners:**  
For beginners, the AI should give step-by-step guidance in simple terms. For advanced learners, it can highlight efficiency, edge cases, and suggest advanced debugging tools—while still avoiding direct fixes.
